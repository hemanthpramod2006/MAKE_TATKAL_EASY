# MAKE_TATKAL_EASY
This project introduces an AI-driven Tatkal booking automation system designed to simplify, optimize, and streamline railway ticket procurement. Users can securely pre-fill all required travel and passenger details, set their preferred budget, and rely on the system to automatically execute the booking the moment Tatkal availability opens. The platform evaluates user inputs, applies intelligent prioritization, simulates dynamic pricing, and completes the end-to-end booking workflow without manual intervention. Integrated components include a wallet module, ML-based decision engine, backend orchestration, and full automation pipelines.
This is my project for my TURBOHAQ'26
